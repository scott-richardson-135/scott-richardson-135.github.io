# Scott Richardson

I'm a Computer Science student at BYU with a focus on cybersecurity. Here are some project's I've worked on!



## [Home Lab Server](https://github.com/scott-richardson-135/home-lab)
Debian server that I built to learn about system administration, docker deployment, security tooling etc. Lots more I want to do with it, but so far I've done ssh hardening, firewall rules, and docker deployment.

## [Assignment Printer](https://github.com/scott-richardson-135/receipt-printer)
I bought an old ethernet receipt printer and made a little python program to get my future assignments from the canvas API, filter them by due date, and print them out into formatted tickets. I've been running it with cron jobs on my home lab.

## (in progress) [Rust Password Manager](https://github.com/scott-richardson-135/passrs)
Haven't done much with this one yet, but I'm in the early stages of building a password manager in rust to learn about secure data storage, rust memory safety, and a bit about cryptography.
