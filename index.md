Welcome to my site! I'm using it to document my learning in cybersecurity, mostly so I don't forget. Topics may include (depending on what I get around to...):

- Malware analysis
- CTF writeups
- Systems-level experimentation

All analysis done on isolated lab environments. Don't copy anything I do because I don't know what I'm doing yet.
