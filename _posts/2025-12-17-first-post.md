I made a blog!

The goal is for me to document my experiments that don't neatly fit into my other projects or coursework etc. The main benefit is to have my past failures and learning experiences documented so that I can grow from it somehow. The primary audience here is future me, but anyone else that stumbles across this is welcome too!

My current interests that I want to document here are:

- Malware analysis 
- Home lab setup and projects
- CTF practice

And I'm sure there will be much more that I'll come across too. 

That's all I have for now! I'll do my best to consistently put my experiments and experiences here and hopefully it's useful for someone.
